# BaseSet

The goal of BaseSet is to facilitate working with sets in an efficient
way. The package implements methods to work on sets, doing intersection,
union, complementary, power sets, cartesian product and other set
operations in a tidy way. Both for classical and fuzzy sets. On fuzzy
sets, elements have a probability to belong to a set.

It also allows to import from several formats used in the life science
world. Like the GMT and the GAF or the [OBO
format](http://www.obofoundry.org/) file for ontologies.

# Related packages

There are several other packages related to sets, which partially
overlap with BaseSet functionality:

  - [sets](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sets)  
    Implements a more generalized approach, that can store functions or
    lists as an element of a set (while BaseSet only allows to store a
    character or factor), but it is harder to operate in a tidy/long
    way. Also the operations of intersection and union need to happen
    between two different objects, while a single TidySet object (the
    class implemented in BaseSet) can store one or thousands of sets.

  - [GSEABase](https://bioconductor.org/packages/GSEABase)  
    Implements a class to store sets and related information, but it
    doesn’t allow to store fuzzy sets and it is also quite slow as it
    creates several classes for annotating each set.

  - [BiocSets](https://bioconductor.org/packages/BiocSets)  
    Implements a tidy class for sets but does not handle fuzzy sets. It
    also has less functionality to operate with sets, like power sets
    and cartesian product. BiocSets was influenced by the development of
    this
    package.

  - [hierarchicalSets](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=hierarchicalSets)  
    This package is focused on clustering of sets that are inside other
    sets and visualizations. However, BaseSet is focused on storing and
    manipulate sets including hierarchical sets.

## Installation

Before installation you might need to install some of the suggested
packages from Bioconductor:

``` r
if (!require("BiocManager")) {
  install.packages("BiocManager")
  BiocManager::install(c("Biobase", "GO.db", "GSEABase", "org.HS.eg.db", 
                         "reactome.db", "BiocStyle"), type = "source")
}
```

You can install the latest version of BaseSet from
[Github](https://github.com/llrs/BaseSet) with:

``` r
BiocManager::install("llrs/BaseSet", 
                     dependencies = TRUE, build_vignettes = TRUE, force = TRUE)
```

## Examples

To work with sets we need to have the relations between the elements and
the sets:

``` r
sets <- list(A = letters[1:5], B = c("a", "f"))
sets_analysis <- tidySet(sets)
sets_analysis
#>   elements sets fuzzy
#> 1        a    A     1
#> 2        a    B     1
#> 3        b    A     1
#> 4        c    A     1
#> 5        d    A     1
#> 6        e    A     1
#> 7        f    B     1
```

Perform typical operations like union, intersection:

``` r
union(sets_analysis, sets = c("A", "B")) 
#>   elements sets fuzzy
#> 1        a  A∪B     1
#> 2        b  A∪B     1
#> 3        c  A∪B     1
#> 4        d  A∪B     1
#> 5        e  A∪B     1
#> 6        f  A∪B     1
# Or we can give a name to the new set and keep the others sets
union(sets_analysis, sets = c("A", "B"), name = "D")
#>   elements sets fuzzy
#> 1        a    D     1
#> 2        b    D     1
#> 3        c    D     1
#> 4        d    D     1
#> 5        e    D     1
#> 6        f    D     1
# We can do the same in the intersection
intersection(sets_analysis, sets = c("A", "B"), name = "D") 
#>   elements sets fuzzy
#> 1        a    D     1
# Or we can omit the new name: 
intersection(sets_analysis, sets = c("A", "B"))
#>   elements sets fuzzy
#> 1        a  A∩B     1
```

And compute size of sets among other things:

``` r
set_size(sets_analysis)
#>   sets size probability
#> 1    A    5           1
#> 2    B    2           1
```

The elements in one set not present in other:

``` r
subtract(sets_analysis, set_in = "A", not_in = "B", keep = FALSE)
#>   elements sets fuzzy
#> 1        b  A∖B     1
#> 2        c  A∖B     1
#> 3        d  A∖B     1
#> 4        e  A∖B     1
```

Or any other verb from
[dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dplyr). Like mutate

``` r
library("magrittr")
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'magrittr'
#> The following object is masked from 'package:BaseSet':
#> 
#>     subtract
set.seed(4673) # To make it reproducible in your machine
sets_analysis %>% 
  mutate(Keep = sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), 7, replace = TRUE)) %>% 
  filter(Keep == TRUE) %>% 
  activate("sets") %>% 
  mutate(sets_origin = c("Reactome", "KEGG"))
#>   elements sets fuzzy Keep sets_origin
#> 1        a    A     1 TRUE    Reactome
#> 2        a    B     1 TRUE        KEGG
#> 3        b    A     1 TRUE    Reactome
#> 4        c    A     1 TRUE    Reactome
#> 5        d    A     1 TRUE    Reactome
#> 6        f    B     1 TRUE        KEGG
```

## Fuzzy sets

You can do the same operations with fuzzy sets:

``` r
relations <- data.frame(sets = c(rep("A", 5), "B", "B"), 
                        elements = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "a", "f"),
                        fuzzy = runif(7))
fuzzy_set <- tidySet(relations)
fuzzy_set
#>   elements sets     fuzzy
#> 1        a    A 0.1837246
#> 2        a    B 0.9381182
#> 3        b    A 0.4567009
#> 4        c    A 0.8152075
#> 5        d    A 0.5800610
#> 6        e    A 0.5724973
#> 7        f    B 0.9460158
union(fuzzy_set, sets = c("A", "B"))
#>   elements sets     fuzzy
#> 1        a  A∪B 0.9381182
#> 2        b  A∪B 0.4567009
#> 3        c  A∪B 0.8152075
#> 4        d  A∪B 0.5800610
#> 5        e  A∪B 0.5724973
#> 6        f  A∪B 0.9460158
union(fuzzy_set, sets = c("A", "B"), name = "D", keep = TRUE)

intersection(fuzzy_set, sets = c("A", "B"), name = "D") 
#>   elements sets     fuzzy
