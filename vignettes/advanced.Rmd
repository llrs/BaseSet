```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE,

# Initial setup

To show compatibility with tidy workflows we will use magrittr pipe operator and the
dplyr verbs.

```{r setupr, message=FALSE}
library("dplyr")
library("BaseSet")
```

# Human GO

We will explore the genes related with GO. 

```{r prepare_GO, message=FALSE}
# We load some libraries
library("org.Hs.eg.db")
library("GO.db")
library("ggplot2")
# Prepare the data 
h2GO_TS <- tidySet(org.Hs.egGO)
h2GO <- as.data.frame(org.Hs.egGO)
```
We can now explore if there are differences in evidence usage for each ontology in GO:
```{r evidence_ontology}
library("forcats")
h2GO %>% 
    group_by(Evidence, Ontology) %>% 
    count(name = "Freq") %>% 
    ungroup() %>% 
    mutate(Evidence = fct_reorder2(Evidence, Ontology, -Freq),
           Ontology = case_when(Ontology == "CC" ~ "Cellular Component",
                                Ontology == "MF" ~ "Molecular Function",
                                Ontology == "BP" ~ "Biological Process",
                                TRUE ~ NA_character_)) %>% 
    ggplot() +
    geom_col(aes(Evidence, Freq)) +
    facet_grid(~Ontology) + 
    theme_bw() +
    coord_flip() +
    xlab("Evidence")
```

We can see that biological process are more likely to be defined by IMP evidence code that means inferred from mutant phenotype. 
While inferred from physical interaction (IPI) is almost exclusively used to assign molecular functions. 

This graph doesn't consider that some relationships are better annotated than other:

```{r nEvidence_plot}
h2GO_TS %>% 
  relations() %>% 
  group_by(elements, sets) %>% 
  count(sort = TRUE) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(n), binwidth = 1) +
  theme_minimal() +
  # scale_y_log10() +
  labs(x = "Evidence codes", 
       title = "Evidence codes for each relation between GO and a gene",
       subtitle = "in human annotation")
```

We can see that mostly all the annotations are done with a single evidence code.
So far we have explored the code that it is related to a gene but how many genes don't have any annotation?

```{r numbers}
# Add all the genes and GO terms
library("GO.db")
h2GO_TS <- add_elements(h2GO_TS, keys(org.Hs.eg.db)) %>% 
  add_sets(grep("^GO:", keys(GO.db), value = TRUE))

sizes_element <- element_size(h2GO_TS) %>% 
    arrange(desc(size))
sum(sizes_element$size == 0)
sum(sizes_element$size != 0)

sizes_set <- set_size(h2GO_TS) %>% 
    arrange(desc(size))
sum(sizes_set$size == 0)
sum(sizes_set$size != 0)
```

So we can see that both there are more genes without annotation and more GO terms without a (direct) gene annotated.

```{r plots_GO}
sizes_element %>% 
    filter(size != 0) %>% 
    ggplot() +
    geom_histogram(aes(size), binwidth = 1) +
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(x = "# sets per element", y = "Count")

sizes_set %>% 
    filter(size != 0) %>% 
    ggplot() +
    geom_histogram(aes(size), binwidth = 1) +
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(x = "# elements per set", y = "Count")
```

As you can see on the second plot we have very large values but that are on associated on many genes:

```{r distr_sizes}
head(sizes_set, 10)
```

This could radically change if we used fuzzy values. 
We could assign a fuzzy value to each evidence code given the lowest fuzzy value for the [IEA (Inferred from Electronic Annotation)](http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/Inferred_from_Electronic_Annotation_(IEA)) evidence.
The highest values would be for evidence codes coming from experiments or alike. 

# Human pathways

Now we will repeat the same analysis with pathways:

```{r prepare_reactome}
# We load some libraries
library("reactome.db")

# Prepare the data (is easier, there isn't any ontoogy or evidence column)
h2p <- as.data.frame(reactomeEXTID2PATHID)
colnames(h2p) <- c("sets", "elements")
# Filter only for human pathways
h2p <- h2p[grepl("^R-HSA-", h2p$sets), ]

# There are duplicate relations with different evidence codes!!: 
summary(duplicated(h2p[, c("elements", "sets")]))
h2p <- unique(h2p)
# Create a tidySet and 
h2p_TS <- tidySet(h2p) %>% 
    # Add all the genes 
    add_elements(keys(org.Hs.eg.db))
```

Now that we have everything ready we can start measuring some things...

```{r numbers_pathways}
sizes_element <- element_size(h2p_TS) %>% 
    arrange(desc(size))
sum(sizes_element$size == 0)
sum(sizes_element$size != 0)

sizes_set <- set_size(h2p_TS) %>% 
    arrange(desc(size))
```

We can see there are more genes without pathways than genes with pathways.

```{r pathways_plots}
sizes_element %>% 
    filter(size != 0) %>% 
    ggplot() +
    geom_histogram(aes(size), binwidth = 1) +
    scale_y_log10() +
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(x = "# sets per element", y = "Count")

sizes_set %>% 
    ggplot() +
    geom_histogram(aes(size), binwidth = 1) +
    scale_y_log10() +
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(x = "# elements per set", y = "Count")
```

As you can see on the second plot we have very large values but that are on associated on many genes:

```{r distr_sizes_pathways}
head(sizes_set, 10)
```

# Session info {.unnumbered}

```{r sessionInfo, echo=FALSE}
sessionInfo()
```
