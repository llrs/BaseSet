# BaseSet

The goal of BaseSet is to facilitate working with sets in an efficient way. The package implements methods to work on sets, doing intersection, union, complementary, power sets, cartesian product and other set operations in a tidy way. Both for classical and fuzzy sets. On fuzzy sets, elements have a probability to belong to a set. 


It also allows to import from several formats used in the life science world. Like the GMT and the GAF or the [OBO format](http://www.obofoundry.org/) file for ontologies.

# Related packages

There are several other packages related to sets, which partially overlap with BaseSet functionality:

 - [sets]( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sets)  
 Implements a more generalized approach, that can store functions or lists as an element of a set (while BaseSet only allows to store a character or factor), but it is harder to operate in a tidy/long way. Also the operations of intersection and union need to happen between two different objects, while a single TidySet object (the class implemented in BaseSet) can store one or thousands of sets.

 - [GSEABase](https://bioconductor.org/packages/GSEABase)  
 Implements a class to store sets and related information, but it doesn't allow to store fuzzy sets and it is also quite slow as it creates several classes for annotating each set. 
  
 - [BiocSets](https://bioconductor.org/packages/BiocSets)  
 Implements a tidy class for sets but does not handle fuzzy sets. It also has less functionality to operate with sets, like power sets and cartesian product. BiocSets was influenced by the development of this package. 

 - [hierarchicalSets](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=hierarchicalSets)  
 This package is focused on clustering of sets that are inside other sets and visualizations. However, BaseSet is focused on storing and manipulate sets including hierarchical sets.

## Installation

Before installation you might need to install some of the suggested packages from Bioconductor:

```{r dep, eval = FALSE}
if (!require("BiocManager")) {
  install.packages("BiocManager")
  BiocManager::install(c("Biobase", "GO.db", "GSEABase", "org.HS.eg.db", 
                         "reactome.db", "BiocStyle"), type = "source")
}
```

You can install the latest version of BaseSet from [Github](https://github.com/llrs/BaseSet) with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
BiocManager::install("llrs/BaseSet", 
                     dependencies = TRUE, build_vignettes = TRUE, force = TRUE)
```

 
## Examples

```{r include=FALSE}
library("BaseSet")
```

To work with sets we need to have the relations between the elements and the sets:

```{r TidySet}
sets <- list(A = letters[1:5], B = c("a", "f"))
sets_analysis <- tidySet(sets)
sets_analysis
```

Perform typical operations like union, intersection:

```{r union-intersection}
union(sets_analysis, sets = c("A", "B")) 
# Or we can give a name to the new set and keep the others sets
union(sets_analysis, sets = c("A", "B"), name = "D")
# We can do the same in the intersection
intersection(sets_analysis, sets = c("A", "B"), name = "D") 
# Or we can omit the new name: 
intersection(sets_analysis, sets = c("A", "B"))
```

And compute size of sets among other things:

```{r set_size}
set_size(sets_analysis)
```

The elements in one set not present in other:

```{r subraction}
subtract(sets_analysis, set_in = "A", not_in = "B", keep = FALSE)
```

Or any other verb from [dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dplyr). Like mutate

```{r dplyr}
library("magrittr")
set.seed(4673) # To make it reproducible in your machine
sets_analysis %>% 
  mutate(Keep = sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), 7, replace = TRUE)) %>% 
  filter(Keep == TRUE) %>% 
  activate("sets") %>% 
  mutate(sets_origin = c("Reactome", "KEGG"))
```

## Fuzzy sets

You can do the same operations with fuzzy sets:

```{r fuzzy}
relations <- data.frame(sets = c(rep("A", 5), "B", "B"), 
                        elements = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "a", "f"),
                        fuzzy = runif(7))
fuzzy_set <- tidySet(relations)
fuzzy_set
union(fuzzy_set, sets = c("A", "B"))
union(fuzzy_set, sets = c("A", "B"), name = "D", keep = TRUE)
intersection(fuzzy_set, sets = c("A", "B"), name = "D") 
intersection(fuzzy_set, sets = c("A", "B"), keep = TRUE)
# Note here the difference:
set_size(fuzzy_set) # A set could be empty!
element_size(fuzzy_set)
fuzzy_set %>% 
  mutate(Keep = ifelse(fuzzy > 0.5, TRUE, FALSE)) %>% 
  filter(Keep == TRUE) %>% 
  activate("sets") %>% 
  mutate(sets_origin = c("Reactome", "KEGG"))
```
